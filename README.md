**All of your design decisions.**

We decided to first focus on adding the functionality to the application. We laid out the skeleton of the application following
the MVC design pattern.

**The reasons behind each decision.**

The MVC format would allow us to have all the SQL data in the Model package, what the user interacted with in the
Views package, and the sort of interconnecting Controller package that makes it possible for the View and Model components to communicate
with each other.

**What went right.**

Nothing. Every step of the way we were met with a new obstacle, something new we did not fully comprehend until we dug in.

**Challenges you faced.**
**Which part you enjoyed working on the most.**

The challenges are what we enjoyed the most. They taught us the most. The testing phase was a particular challenge for us, particularly 
when testing for the user role. There was a journey in tryoing to connect how every component fit together from the annotations 
to the MVC model manifested as code. In order to test the individual blocks of code we had to understand what they did and how they
interacted with the bigger whole. How role played a part in the app was also difficult to grasp as there was a complicated relationship
between the existance of a user and its role. At least in the way the code was already step up for us. We found, for eaxmple, that
the database has to establish the role of user for the user top sign up. We had not been thinking of how we needed to get the database up
and running, we had just been focusing on the code and thinking that was all of the program. Playing with each endpoint was fun, as you
didn't know what to expect. Assuming everything went right you knew the result you were going to get. But often times the reuslt was 
not what we expected or wanted.
